					<p> The Talented Mr Ripley is a 1999 psychological thriller that adopts the pretty unique point of view of the clever, somewhat shy and insecure Tom Ripley, a young man struggling to make it in the cutthroat climate of New York in the Fifties. </p>

					<p> Essentially, Tom Ripley yearns to be somebody else ("I always thought it'd be better to be a fake somebody than a real nobody") and will ultimately use his "talents" &mdash; forgery, lying and impersonation &mdash; to pursue his dream, starting off by manipulating a rich businessman, who sends Tom to Italy to "rescue" his son Dickie from his opulent lifestyle with his fianc&eacute;e Marge. <br>
					When Tom meets Dickie, he immediately falls captive to his alluring charm and charisma, as well as his decadent lifestyle under the 1950s Italian sun. </p>

					<p>In many ways, The Talented Mr Ripley is reminiscent of Kill Your Darlings: both tell stories of murder, obsession, the deceptive nature of charm and the reinvention of self, and both seem to contain a character who exudes a magnetic, almost hypnotic, charm that draws in everyone they're surrounded by. For The Talented Mr Ripley, this is Dickie Greenleaf. For Kill Your Darlings, Lucien Carr. And similarly, both of these characters never seem to need these people as much as these people need them.</p>

					<p> When Dickie gradually starts to lose interest in Tom and his almost off-putting clinginess, the tone of the film changes radically and Tom finds himself in a web of lies and deceit. It's interesting to note, however, that the Tom Ripley from Minghella's film lacks the same icy ruthlessness from Rene Clement's Ripley in <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWnvLNTzt-k">Plein Soleil</a> (and from what I've understood the books which both films are based on, which I have to admit I've never read), and comes off almost as an "accidental psychopath" cornered by circumstance and situation. </p>

					<p> Without giving too much away (I'm afraid I've probably already done that though), The Talented Mr. Ripley is an eery story about the fatality of obsession told with a pretty mesmerising aesthetic. </p>
